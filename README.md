<h1>SQL Query Demonstration Application</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Welcome to the SQL Query Demonstration Application README. This ASP.NET MVC application is designed to showcase SQL queries and search functionality for accessing databases and displaying information. The application utilizes a SQL database hosted on Azure, containing a demonstration dataset provided in a previous database class. The dataset has been enhanced with facial recognition technology to add faces to names, providing a more engaging and visually appealing demonstration of SQL query results.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>SQL Queries Demonstration:</strong> The application demonstrates various SQL queries, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and complex JOIN operations. These queries showcase how to retrieve, modify, and manipulate data stored in the database.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Users can utilize search functionality to query the database based on specific criteria, such as name, age, gender, etc. The application dynamically generates SQL queries based on user input and displays relevant results.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Visual Representation:</strong> The dataset used in the application has been enhanced with facial recognition technology to add faces to names. This visually appealing feature enhances the demonstration of SQL query results, making it more engaging and accessible to users, particularly incoming students learning about databases and SQL.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment:</h2>
<p>The SQL Query Demonstration Application is deployed on Azure, utilizing Azure App Service for hosting the ASP.NET MVC application. Additionally, an Azure SQL Database hosts the demonstration dataset, providing live access to the database for query demonstrations.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC:</strong> The backend of the application is developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework, providing a structured approach to building web applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Azure:</strong> The application is hosted on the Azure cloud platform, leveraging services such as Azure App Service for deployment and Azure SQL Database for data storage.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL Database:</strong> Azure SQL Database is used to store and manage the demonstration dataset, containing enhanced information with faces.</li>
  <li><strong>C#:</strong> The application is primarily developed in C#, the programming language used for building ASP.NET applications.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> Frontend components of the application are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>To access the SQL Query Demonstration Application, navigate to the deployed URL on Azure. Upon accessing the application, users can interact with various SQL queries, utilize search functionality, and explore the enhanced visual representation of SQL query results with faces.</p>
